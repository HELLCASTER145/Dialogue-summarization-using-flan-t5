Dialogue Summarization with FLAN-T5 (Practice Model)
This is a README file for a practice dialogue summarization model using FLAN-T5. This model is designed for educational purposes and is not intended for high-performance tasks.

Model Overview:

This model utilizes FLAN-T5, a powerful pre-trained language model from Google AI, for dialogue summarization. FLAN-T5 is fine-tuned on a sample dialogue dataset to learn how to extract the key points from a conversation and generate a concise summary.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x (or PyTorch, depending on chosen implementation)
Hugging Face Transformers library (https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/transformers)
Dataset containing dialogues and corresponding summaries (e.g., DialogSum: https://github.com/cylnlp/dialogsum)
